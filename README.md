# ClientReportsGenerator

My junior year of college I started a job as a part-time data processor. This was my first time using a computer for something other than writing essays and watching Youtube videos. 

My job consisted of scrubbing data files and, most importantly, building metrics reports once a week for the company's biggest client. These reports consisted of making pivot tables in Excel and putting them in PowerPoint reports, ~14 reports a week with ~10 pivot tables each. This took my full time in the office those days, all four hours.

Working in Excel inspired me to take Computing in Data at school (UC Berkeley). Then, I took a few CS classes and a couple more programming in R courses. As I gained those skills, I used my free time in the office to build a program that automated the job of building weekly reports. With the permission of my former company, details omitted, I put the program here on Github.

This program automatically builds the reports, with added flexibility for adding non-built-in pivot tables and adding non-built-in reports for special circumstances. Additionally, if a pivot table is too long, this program renders it in the PowerPoint report in shorter pieces.

Lastly, before graduating and leaving this small company, a company I worked at for two years, I wrote a detailed user guide so my boss could use the program indefinitely into the future. The entire program and user guide, details omitted, is here.
